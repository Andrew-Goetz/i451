# i451

Projects I completed in a systems programming course. I received max credit for all of these projects.

It was a very good course; essentially, in each project we used a new form of POSIX IPC. We did processes, FIFOs, and shared memory with semaphores. The first project just does file I/O stuff in Rust, while the last project was writing a basic web server in Rust.

Most of the projects import libraries that were provided by the professor, which are not included in the repository. Other than these libraries, the vast majority of the code written here was from scratch.
