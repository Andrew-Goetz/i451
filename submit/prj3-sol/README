Details: First, known fifo named 'notify' will be created by knnd, and knnd
will wait in a read until a knnc process writes its PID to the known fifo.
Private FIFOs will be created by the client in the server directory for
communication between the client and the worker process.  The daemon creates
the worker process, passing it the PID so it can communicate with the client.

There will be 2 private FIFOs per client and worker process; one is named
[Client-PID]_in, other is named [Client-PID]_out.

Using the out FIFO, the client writes a DataBytesKnn struct to the worker,
which will use that struct to run the knn function. Before this, however, the
client will write a single int to the worker containing the current value of i
in the for loop.

The worker will read this data written to the out FIFO, call the knn function,
and return an array of 3 unsigned ints to the client via the in FIFO: index 0
holds the nearest_index value, index 1 holds the predicted label, and index 2
holds the expected label.

The client process will set the index value to -1. When the worker sees this
value, it will exit the loop.
