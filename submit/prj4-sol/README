Details:

The size of the shared memory segment is 784 + sizeof(unsigned)*2 +
sizeof(int), where 784 = size of a single test image, the first
unsigned is the result of knn_from_data_bytes, and the second unsigned
is the label from the training data. This data will be stored as a struct.

There is a SERVER_SEM semaphore (initialized to 1) that the client will decrement when it wants to use the server, then increment it when it is done with the server.

Server waits on the REQUEST semaphore until a client, after getting through SERVER_SEM wait, sends a request and increments REQUEST. Client then waits for response, and server increments RESPONSE semaphore after a response is written to shared memory.

There is a util.h file that has some shared definitions between the two programs (such as names of IPC facilites).

When there's an error, the process will print error message and goto a cleanup segment of the code to deallocate local process resources (mainly file descriptors and semaphores).
