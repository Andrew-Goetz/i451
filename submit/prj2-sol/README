Details:
parent_to_child pipe will have parent process write image data and worker processes read that image data, which they will then process.
child_to_parent pipe will have worker processes write its result and parent process will read the pipe to recieve the result.
At end of code, parent will wait() for each individual child process to terminate (we will record child PIDs so we can wait for each child individually).
If an error is encountered send out a signal (maybe) that will tell child processes to stop.
